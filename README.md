my understanding and application of Python programming in real-world scenarios. Each task focused on a specific domain such as API integration, report automation, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (ML). Below is a brief overview of the tasks, along with the tools and technologies used and the editor I preferred throughout the internship
Task 1: API Integration and Data Visualization
The first task involved creating a Python script that fetches data from a public API—OpenWeatherMap in my case—and visualizes the information using Matplotlib and Seaborn
API Integration and Data Visualization involves connecting external or internal data sources through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and presenting the retrieved data in a visual format such as charts, graphs, or dashboards. The goal is to streamline data collection, enable real-time updates, and improve decision-making through intuitive and interactive visual representations. This process is commonly used in web and mobile applications, business intelligence platforms, and data analytics tools.
Objective:
The goal of this task is to use Python to connect to a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap), extract relevant data, process it, and visualize it using graphs or charts. This helps in understanding data patterns and trends efficiently
